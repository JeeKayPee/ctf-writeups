# 02 - Challenge Two

Dude, where's challenge 2?

It should be here: [Challenge Two](https://he-archive.sieber.space/challenge-two)

Looks like the _Challenge Two_ could not be found (HTTP 404). However, thinking a bit, why is the page
in Icelandic (a good hint is the famous volcano _Eyjafjallaj√∂kull_)?

The next hint is the highlighted part in "/challenge-**two**". So let's ty to translate to Icelandic!

The correct path is `/challange-tveir`:

Congrats, you found an egg!
