Let's start with [frequency analysis](https://www.dcode.fr/frequency-analysis):
```
G	115×        5.64%	
R	105×        5.15%	 
Y	102×        5%	
L	99×         4.86%	
M	99×	    4.86%	
F	93×	    4.56%	
I	90×	    4.41%	
C	90×	    4.41%	
V	89×	    4.36%	
W	85×	    4.17%	
N	85×	    4.17%	
..
```

Likely a [polyalphabetic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher).
[Index of coincidence](https://www.dcode.fr/index-coincidence) is `0.04017` which, again,
points to a polyalphabetic cipher. The most famous one is, probably,
[Vignere cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

The most [probable key lengths](https://www.dcode.fr/index-coincidence) are:
```
L=22 IC ≈ 0.0666 ± 0.011
L=11 IC ≈ 0.05637 ± 0.019
```

The more fun approach is to try decrypting by hand by guessing the plain text.
Using this [online implementation of Vignere cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher)
makes it much easier:
- `XHW` is very likely `THE` and so the key must start with `EAS`
- The key could start with `EASTER`
- And so on ..

There are also some tools to help you crack the key.
I used https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher.
It guesses the most probable keys. On the top position is `isveryfunny` followed by 
`easterbunny`. So simply combining them gives us the correct key `easterbunnyisveryfunny`.

The key length prediction based on the index of coincidence was correct - 22 characters.

Now we can decrypt the full text and read the password:
```
ULTIMATELY, WE CONCLUDE, THAT THE PASSWORD FOR THE EGG IS "BULLSHITGENERATOR".
