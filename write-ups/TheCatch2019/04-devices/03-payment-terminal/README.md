# Payment Terminal (4p)
_Hi Commander,_

_one of the rebellious smart payment terminals in the library has somehow acquired
access to the local networking devices and it has started to deploy its own configuration.
Old network monitoring system under our control has captured the traffic of configuration
deployment. We believe that you will be able to analyse the captured traffic, find some
security problem in data transfer, and acquire the configuration file(s). Good luck!_
