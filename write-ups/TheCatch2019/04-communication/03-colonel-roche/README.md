# Colonel Roche (5p)
_Hi Commander,_

_did you know that the berserkers, which were assigned to specific tasks, have used to name
themselves after humans famous in given field of specialization (this behaviour is maybe
some bug in their firmware)? Our infiltrators - remotely operated classic devices equiped
with stickers `I'm smart` and `Death to humans` - have discovered a new Berserker named `Colonel
Roche`, which is responsible for encrypting the commands for the other less or more smart
devices. Your previous successes obviously forced the Berserkers to improve the security of
communication. You are supposed to find some way how to decrypt a captured message and read
the issued command(s). The infiltrators report that this particular machine usually uses a day
of week as a key (maybe `monday`, maybe `saturday`, maybe something else... they are not sure)._

_Good luck!_
